# Hi!
### Welcome to my portfolio!
What lies ahead is a small collection of the playable ads I have made over the past 2 years as a game developer at [Simple Duck Studios](https://www.simpleduckstudios.com/). This is a pretty small subset of my work, but thus far I have developed over 100 ads for a ton of different games. These ads were all developed using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and coded by me. In some cases the art was provided to me by the game's developers, but a typical project will see me working in Unity and Photoshop to render out the assets I need to create the playable in Phaser. 

Enjoy!

Note: A fancier version of this portolfio is in the works, but for now you should be able to get a reasonable simulation of how these ads function on a mobile device using the device toggle found in the developer tools on most web browsers.
